# team-profile-generator
challenge 10

## Description
This project is a Node.js command-line application that generates a team profile. It allows users to enter the general information about their employees of a software engineering team. The application would then take the input to generate an HTML page that displays a summary of each team member.
The HTML putput can be viewed at this[link](https://xoerycaxo.github.io/team-profile-generator/) and [here](https://github.com/xoerycaxo/team-profile-generator/blob/main/dist/index.html) to see my index.html file.
